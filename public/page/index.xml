      <description>I am broadly interested in the evolution of behavior from a evolutionary and cultural perspective, as well as the interplay between these two. I worked on hummingbird behavior during my PhD, and also explored the evolution of learned vocal signals in other groups using comparative analyses during my time at the Lab of O. I am currently working on social communication in communal roosting bats as postdoc at Universidad de Costa Rica.</description>
