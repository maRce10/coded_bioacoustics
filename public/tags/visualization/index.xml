      <description>The R package dynaSpec can now be installed from github. This is a set of tools to generate dynamic spectrogram visualizations in video format. It is still on the making and new visualizations will be available soon. FFMPEG must be installed in order for this package to work.&#xA;To install dynaSpec from github you will need the R package devtools:&#xA;# From github devtools::install_github(&amp;#34;maRce10/dynaSpec&amp;#34;) #load package library(dynaSpec) Examples To run the following examples you will also need to load a few more packages:</description>

      <title>Interactive maps from Xeno-Canto recording localities in xc_maps()</title>

      <description>The function xc_maps() from the R package warbleR let users visualize the geographic spread of recordings from Xeno-Canto downloaded through the quer_xc() function. However, the graphs are static, which becomes a bit painful when looking at many recordings. Fortunately the R package leaflet allows to create interactive maps in which users can zoom in at specific areas, check observation medatada and link observations to their Xeno-Canto webpage. This capability is now available in xc_maps().</description>

      <description>Some people have asked for the code we used to make figure 3 in the Methods in Ecology and Evolution paper describing warbleR. So, here it is. The figure was made in part by my collaborator Grace Smith-Vidaurre, so thanks to Grace for sharing.&#xA;The figure shows the grouping of long-billed hermit songs in the acoustic space based on similarity of dominant frequency contours. Similarity was assessed using dynamic time warping.</description>
